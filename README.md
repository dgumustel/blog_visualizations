# blog_visualizations
This repository is for creating and storing visualizations made for my [Ocean Data Science blog](https://oceandatascience.medium.com/).

### Chlorophyll
The notebook in this repo requires a 'data' subdirectory containing .nc files from the [NASA MODIS-Aqua satellite](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MY1DMM_CHLORA&date=2019-02-01). You should be able to clone this repository and run the notebook straight out of the box on your machine if you don't alter the file structure. The notebook will create a visualizations subdirectory in the same location as the notebook; this is where figures will be saved.
