# blog_visualizations
This repository is for creating and storing visualizations made for my [Ocean Data Science blog](https://oceandatascience.medium.com/).

### Chlorophyll
This repo provides you with a 'data' subdirectory containing .nc files from the [NASA MODIS-Aqua satellite](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=MY1DMM_CHLORA&date=2019-02-01). The notebook will create a visualizations subdirectory in the same location as the notebook; this is where figures will be saved.
